# Filler Edit

This is the map editor for my ![Filler Game](https://github.com/vostertag/filler-game).

Once the user chose the size of the grid and the number of players, an empty grid is displayed:

The user can choose a color by clicking on one of the squares that are at the bottom of the window, as well as who is going to own it (either a player or noone (0)):

Once all of the grid is colored, the map can be saved and then used in the game.
